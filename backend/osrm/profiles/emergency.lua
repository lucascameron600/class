-- LUKES CUSTOM SF PROFILE
--
-- MAIN ROUTE SETTINGS TO CHANGE
--
-- after changes to process_turns all of the settings besides speed table effect route choice and not the duration
-- stan will estimate road speeds so thats how it will be handled
-- make sure if you feed stop signs into stan you undo changes to process_turn so that the signals and stops will effect duration as well
-- or else stan will absorb
--
-- turn_penalty raising makes routes straighter, fewer staircase, lower more turns
-- turn_bias    raising makes lefts cost more than rights, lowering rights cost more than lefts
-- u_turn_penalty raising it makes routes go around the block, lowering makes more u turns
-- control_penalties
--      signal: raising avoids signalized arterials, lowering makes signals not matter as much
--      stop: raising can avoid residential streets where stops are mapped, lowering makes unmapped stops matter less
--
-- class_preference raising residentials will make them have more prefernce.
-- 
-- WHEN READY TO TUNE
--
-- fix speeds mostly dont, keep signals and stops low and equal,
-- tune turn penalty and residentail speed pref together
-- tune turn bias
-- 
-- tune one at a time and score
-- compare to predetermined metrics across car.lua and emergency.lua
